Data Extraction Techniques
This document summarizes the key points from a video on data extraction techniques.

Raw Data Sources
Data is everywhere and much of it is highly sensitive and personal, requiring careful handling for privacy and other concerns. Here are some examples of raw data sources:

Archived text and images from paper documents and PDFs
Web pages, including text, tables, images, and links
Analog audio and video, recorded on media such as magnetic tapes or streaming in real time
Survey data, statistical, and economic data
Transactional data from business, financial, real estate, and point-of-sale (POS) transactions
Event-based data such as social media streams
Weather data from weather station networks
Internet of Things (IoT) sensor streams
Medical records, such as prescription history, medical treatments, and medical images
Personal genetic data encoded in DNA and RNA samples

Data Extraction Techniques
There are many techniques for extracting data, depending on the kind of data source and the intended use of the data. Examples include:

Optical character recognition (OCR) for digitizing text scanned from paper documents
Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for digitizing analog audio recordings and signals, and charge-coupled devices (CCDs) for capturing and digitizing images
Polling and census methods for obtaining opinions, questionnaires, and vital statistical data
Cookies, user logs, and other methods for tracking human or system behavior
Web scraping for crawling web pages in search of text, images, tables, and hyperlinks
APIs for extracting data from online data repositories and feeds
SQL languages for querying relational databases, and NoSQL for querying document, key-value, graph or other non-structured data repositories
Edge computing devices for extracting features from raw data
Biomedical devices, such as microfluidic arrays for extracting DNA sequences
Use Cases
Here are a few high-level examples of use cases, along with their raw data sources and extraction techniques:

APIs can be used to extract data from multiple structured data sources for integration into a central repository, or to capture periodic or asynchronous events to store them in a history archive
Edge computing can be used to reduce data volume by extracting features of interest from the raw data of IoT devices
Medical imaging devices and biometric sensors can be used to acquire data for diagnostic purposes
In conclusion, many extraction techniques rely on sophisticated technology to capture information from raw data. SQL, NoSQL, web scraping, and APIs are important techniques for extracting data.
